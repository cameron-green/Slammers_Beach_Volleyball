    <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
    <p>Other advertising will be kept consistent for a period until the end of August (except for the new web site), so that any increase in customers will be attributable to the site.</p>
    <p>At the end of August (and during the period from site launch), the number of new customers through the door and the number of new sign-ups will be counted and compared to the previous period.
